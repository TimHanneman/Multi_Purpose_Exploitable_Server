                The resident virus is one primary type of file infector. As mentioned on the home page, it installs <br />
                itself on a computer and is sometimes very difficult to remove. This virus can be hard to spot, thus  <br />
                making it harder to remove. The slow infector, one area of the resident virus, is an example of when <br />
                the virus could be difficult to notice as the symptoms develop slowly. However, the second area, the <br />
                fast infector is much easier to notice because it's job is to create as much damage as fast as <br/>
                possible. An anti-virus will not always be able to protect you, the resident virus has the ability to <br />
                attach itself to an anti-virus software and infect every file the software accesses. Therefore, <br />
                needing a unique tool to completely remove the virus.
