# TESTING_ BRANCH_Multi_Purpose_Exploitable_Server
"The software will be building a network server from scratch that at startup will have the ability to selectively enable insecure portions of code that can be exploited. The software could be developed as a honeypot for detection of exploitation attempts within a network and/or as a practice server for pentesters.  The project may also need to develop companion software that can test the code, or collect logs from the server."
