# Multi-Purpose Exploitable Server
## Capsone project - CST 499 Spring 2021

### Project Motivation

Network and computer security are a major concern in today's computing environment. According to a study done by Radware, cybersecurity attacks that succeed cost businesses $1.1 million dollars on average. Cybersecurity attacks can be a huge drain on an organization's resources. With the knowledge of intrudersâ€™ methods for exploiting a service we can better strengthen and protect our networks from real threats, ultimately saving time and money. 

### Project Description

We have created web server software with insecure modules that can be utilized by those involved in cybersecurity to practice their pen-testing skills. Of the insecure modules that the server contains, one is exploitable with command injection through the URL string. The server includes logging to detect potential network intrusions. The user also has the option to start the server with a graphical user interface, or from a shell. With the use of our software: cybersecurity novices can increase their knowledge of common attack methods, and detect network intrusions when utilized as a honey-pot.

Our team is made up of: 
* Timothy Hanneman, [TimHanneman](https://github.com/TimHanneman)
* Alicia Sandoval, [alicias455](https://github.com/alicias455)
* Tessa Rosasco, [trosasco](https://github.com/trosasco)

### Minimum Viable Product

A web server that can host web pages for multiple users, that can be selectivly exploitable to at least one vulnerability and upto three. Our server can be run either from a shell or a GUI.

### Command Line Args

1. Specify the IP address used to create a socket to listen on
  * -ip, --ip_address
2. Specify the port number that will be listened to
  * -p, --port
3. Specify if you want to run this from the gui or not. (Will cause other options to be disregarded)
  * -gui, --graphical
4. Used to enable the cross-site-scripting vulnerability.
  * -xss, --cross_site_scripting
5. Used to enable the command injection vulnerability. This will also enable xss currently.
  * -cmd, --comand_injection

### Timeline

1. Feb. 15th - March 26th
    - Build the web server
    - Create the web pages
    - Add server logs and alerts
    - Make a GUI
2. March 27th - April 23rd
    - Modularize the code
    - Add threading
    - Work on the vulnerabilities
    - Command injection
    - Cross-site scripting
    - Stack buffer overflow
3. April 24th - April 30th
    - Create a makefile
    - Create documentation

### Languages
* Python - web server
* C - some exploitable code
* HTML/CSS - web pages

### Installation
A makefile is provided, there may be some differences depending on system used. Shown below is some steps for different operating systems. to get it up and running.
Requires the installation of python 3.9.1 https://www.python.org/downloads/

Try "make" if that doesn't work see below per OS you are using.

	#WINDOWS
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install --upgrade pyspark
	pip install argparse
	pip install Pyside6
	
	#UBUNTU
	python3 -m pip install argparse
	python3 -m pip install pyspark pyside6
	sudo apt install libopengl0 -y

	#FEDORA LINUX
	sudo dnf install -y libglvnd-opengl
	pip3 install PySide6
	pip3 install PySpark
 
### Starting the Server
	python main.py
	
or<br>

	python3 main.py -p 8080 -ip 127.0.0.1
